# MLE-Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator-of-the-mean-and-the-variance-of-a-Gaussian
This repository explore how to derive the MLE parameters of a gaussian distribution. It contains the derivation of the theorical MLE 
parameters and a practical example of the empirical computation of the parameters. At the end, we demonstrate that both methods give 
realy similar results.
